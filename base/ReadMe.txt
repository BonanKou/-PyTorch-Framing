Dear TA:
There are two things to keep in mind while running my homework:
1. I failed to build a neurol network solution so I only submitted the linear regression model.
2. The linear regression model runs slower than I expected. So I stored a previously learned model and load it in the code. In order to train from start,
please open "main.py" and uncomment line 156, comment out line 159. Thanks!
